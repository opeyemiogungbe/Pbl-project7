# IMPLEMETING DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION
This project is created to help introduce some vital set of DevOps tools that will help our team in day to day activities in managing, developing, testing, deploying and monitoring different projects. These tools are the best and widely use around the world by multiple DevOps teams, so we are going to create a single DevOps Tooling Solution that will consist of:

**1. Jenkins** – Jenkins is a popular tool for automation and continuous integration in software development. It is an open-source server that runs on Java and allows developers to build, test, and deploy software in an automated way. Jenkins has many features and plugins that make it easy to configure and customize. Some of the benefits of using Jenkins are:

* It can run on different platforms and environments.

* It can integrate with various source code management tools, such as Git, SVN, etc.

* It can trigger builds based on various events, such as code changes, scheduled time, etc.

* It can execute different types of tests, such as unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, etc.

* It can generate reports and feedback on the build status and quality.

* It can support parallel and distributed builds across multiple machines.


**2. Kubernetes** – Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that helps manage and deploy applications at scale. The system is designed to simplify life cycle management, allowing developers to focus on their application code rather than infrastructure maintenance. It offers features like self-healing, automatic scaling, and load balancing, making it an ideal solution for large-scale deployments. Kubernetes is also highly extensible, allowing users to add new functionality as needed. Additionally, Kubernetes is open source and backed by a large community of developers, making it a versatile and widely-used platform.


**3. Jfrog Artifactory** – JFrog Artifactory is a universal DevOps solution for hosting, managing, and distributing binaries and artifacts of any type of software in binary form – such as application installers, container images, libraries, configuration files, etc. – can be curated, secured, stored, and delivered using Artifactory. Artifactory also serves as your central hub for DevOps, integrating with your tools and processes to improve automation, increase integrity, and incorporate best practices along the way1. Artifactory supports over 30 natively integrated package and file types, as well as generic repositories for everything else. It can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid or multi-cloud environment and also enables you to control the full lifecycle of your binaries, from build to release to archival

**4. Rancher** – Rancher is a complete container management platform for Kubernetes, giving you the tools to successfully run Kubernetes anywhere. it is also an open source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage Docker and Kubernetes in production.

**5. Grafana** – Grafana is an open-source observability platform for visualizing metrics, logs, and traces collected from your applications. It's a cloud-native solution for quickly assembling data dashboards that let you inspect and analyze your stack.
**6. Prometheus** – An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.

**7. Kibana**  – Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack.

**This project implementataion will consists of following components:**

* Infrastructure: AWS
* Webserver Linux: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
* Database Server: Ubuntu 20.04 + MySQL
* Storage Server: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 + NFS Server
* Programming Language: PHP
* Code Repository: GitHub
